I believe a complete all of the obligatory parts of the assigment, it took me around 8 hours to do it... I'm tired

For the About Me page I did the extra part Advanced styles (hyperlinks not underlined and drop-caps)

For the Recipe page I did the first 3 extra features (background, favicon and pie bullet)

For the Recipe took me a lot of time because it was hard for me to navigate the instructions, I found them hard to read.
Had some trouble with the url's because still I'm not used to it and also to styling the tags.
